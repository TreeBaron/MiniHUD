# MiniHUD

An X-Plane plugin that shows a small instrument panel for flying
without seeing the cockpit.

Sometimes I like to fly from the external view, or on a small laptop
screen where the cockpit instruments are very hard to read. I created
the MiniHUD to make X-Plane usable in these situations.

Bind a button to miniHUD â†’ show/hide miniHUD to switch the HUD on or
off.
